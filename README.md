# Activity Browser Online

Launch reproducible [Activity Browser](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser) sessions and distribute them using NoVNC.

**This project is not maintained by the Activity Browser team.**

## Current state

This project has been released in 1.0.

It has been successfully tested in a Debian virtual machine, in a local network. It has not been fully implemented in a real network environment yet.

Thus it is likely that a real use will need some adaptations of the code to fit user's real environment.

## Quick start

See **Documentation** bellow.
