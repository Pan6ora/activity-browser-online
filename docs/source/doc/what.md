# What is Activity Browser Online ?

Like SimaPRO Online, Activity Browser Online goal is to make AB available in a web browser.

The end-user interface has two main parts :

- users sessions (Activity Browser machines accessible from the web browser)
- admin panel (a web interface to create and manage previous machines)

## Use case

This project is currently developed for the [G-SCOP laboratory](https://g-scop.grenoble-inp.fr/en) for educational purpose. When giving lessons to students in multiple universities it can be hard to have Activity Browser installed on every computer. A web browser embedded solution make things easier. It also gives the ability to manage different Activity Browser setup for different lessons.
